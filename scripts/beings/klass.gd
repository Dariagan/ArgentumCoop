# class shouldn't change how much you are capable of carrying
# class shouldn't give any type of damage reduction
# class should give unique unlockable abilities (like diablo abilities?)
# RACES shouddn't give unique unlockable abilities, instead, create a class only available for that race which has the abilities you need
#make it inherit from the common basic class with no abilities if you need the general type (like Warrior)
